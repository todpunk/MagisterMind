Simple Mastermind™ Clone for Windows

The console version is pretty much done.  The GUI version is not, and it will take a bit.  We'll be striving, over time, for the following:

- Selection of colors by click and fan-out from a pin
- Simple graphics included
- Some configuration options for multiple game tweaks (code size, possibilities, guesses)
- Maybe (maybe) an installer

Mastermind™ is a Trademark of someone else, I believe Hasbro.  This is not their work, and is not related other than being a clone of the same rules as their board game, and the original games invented by completely different people that are not Hasbro.  I just respect their trademark, unlike a bunch of other clones.
